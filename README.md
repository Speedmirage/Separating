# What Does this Program Do?

This program will ask the user for two different numbers and find their quotient and their remainder. Then the program will ask how many digits long will your next number be. Finally, you must enter a number with the amount of digits you said earlier. I.e, 5 digits, 72832. 

## Things to Keep in Mind
1. If you deside to input more than the amount of digits you detailed; the program will automatically take only the number of digits you detailed + 1. 

## How to Run it?
1. Just run [Separating Digits](http://cpp.sh/2azkm) and follow the command promps
2. Enjoy!
